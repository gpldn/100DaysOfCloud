# OpenHack Preparation

## Cloud Research

Had a light reading session tonight in preparation for my first OpenHack event tomorrow morning! I had a read through the following content on the Microsoft website to try and ready myself:

* Cloud migration in the Cloud Adoption Framework
* Azure migration guide: Before you start
*	Cloud rationalization
*	Migration tools decision guide

I'm quite nervous about the OpenHack event. I've never done anything like it before, and I may or may not have stalked the people on my team via LinkedIn to see where I stand in terms of experience. I probably shouldn't have as some of these have been working in IT since before I was brought into this world, and that's only made me more nervous and self-conscious. I don't want to be that guy that slows the team down. Oh well, I'm just going to go into it with an open mind and try and learn as much as I can and see where the 3 days take me. 

Wish me luck!
