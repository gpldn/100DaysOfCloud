# EXAM DAY!

## Cloud Research
The day has come for my first attempt at the AZ-104. I'm not 100% sure I'm ready, but if I keep putting things off until I'm 100% ready, I would be waiting forever. I've already come to terms with the fact that if I fail, it's fine. It's a really tough exam, and people with WAY more experience than myself have failed this multiple times over.

This morning I read through all of my study notes I made in Notion as a recap. I'm not sure if I will do much more before my exam. I'll probably go for a walk and relax.
