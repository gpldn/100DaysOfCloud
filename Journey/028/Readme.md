# EXAM DAY! PASSED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

## Cloud Research
The day has come for my first attempt at the AZ-104. I'm not 100% sure I'm ready, but if I keep putting things off until I'm 100% ready, I would be waiting forever. I've already come to terms with the fact that if I fail, it's fine. It's a really tough exam, and people with WAY more experience than myself have failed this multiple times over.

This morning I read through all of my study notes I made in Notion as a recap. I'm not sure if I will do much more before my exam. I'll probably go for a walk and relax. 

Reporting back now that I've finished the exam.... AND I PASSED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So happy to have passed. The exam was really, really tough, and I do honestly feel like luck played a part in the pass. No doubt, I have been putting the work in, but there was a lot on there that just threw me off. Passed with a score of 807.

I've definitely got a long way to go, and a lot of areas to improve on. Whilst I'm happy with the pass, I'm not happy to leave this content alone and pretend as if I have the capability to go out in the real world and do all of this stuff. I'm having a few days, maybe a week off from study and then it's back on to labs. At least now I don't have the pressure of the exam looming over me.

Onwards and upwards from here on!
