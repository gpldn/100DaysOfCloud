# First of 100

## Cloud Research

Today I took some time out of the weekend to run through the "Implement and manage storage in Azure" module provided by MS Learn [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/az-104-manage-storage/).

After completeing a pratice exam from WhizLabs yesterday, I felt like I struggled with a few questions related to storage in Azure. I'm hoping this will help me understand some of the key concepts further. Covered some important things in the module: 
- Why choosing the correct disk storage is important
- Reflected on different replication types in Azure
- Understood the failover process
- Dipped into Azure File Shares and their uses/benefits

## Social Proof

I don't have Twitter at this moment in time and haven't been sharing this elsewhere. I'm using this is a personal log for now.
