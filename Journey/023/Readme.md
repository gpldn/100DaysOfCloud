# AZ-104 Study

## Cloud Research

Another day of study. 5 days to go.

Again, I ran through some more of the check list, same as the previous days. My next steps for the evening are going to be to run through my results of the practice test I last passed on WhizLabs, and find out what I got wrong. I'll then take another practice exam of a different test I've not taken in a while. I've had very few attempts at these exams, so I do believe that my results are genuine and not a case of me remembering the questions/answers.
