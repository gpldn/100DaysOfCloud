# Sunday Funday (Snow Day!)

## Introduction

I thought I would take a lighter approach today as it's a Sunday and it's been a very full on week. I kicked off my afternoon with a practice exam from WhizLabs. I was interrupted by my little brother to come out and play in the snow before I could read through the exam report.  

## Use Case

I wanted to see where I was at in terms of my knowledge. I understand I've not been doing this for very long and I did not expect to pass, but the score did leave me a little surprised and confused at the same time. 

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

At some points of the practice exam I felt quite overwhelmed. It felt like a losing battle from the offset. I kept asking myself if I had gone over this material before or not? If I had, why was it not sticking?

However, the final result left me a little confused. Nearly a pass score, but I'm not sure if I'm underestimating myself, or if it was just blind luck at points. Either way, I've learnt that there is stil a very very long way to go in not only passing the exam, but fully understanding the content.

To anyone why may be reading this too, I didn't just start studying yesterday. I have completed the Scott Duffy course on Udemy here(https://www.udemy.com/course/70533-azure/) prior to beginning the 100DaysOfCloud challenge. 

## Next Steps

I've collated a short list of things I need to brush up on and get into the finer details. I was looking through my course notes I took in Notion for the Scott Duffy course, and I feel like some of these topics were not covered. That or I just wasn't paying enough attention! 

I plan to use the list as light reading this evening, or tomorrow evening. The list is as follows:
