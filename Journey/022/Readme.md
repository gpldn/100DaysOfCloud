AZ-104 Study

Another day of study. 7 days to go.

I ran through the check list from Thomas Maurer again. Just crossing off things as I work through them. Before I went to bed I did another WhizLabs exam which I had only attempted once a while back. I couldn't actually remember the questions, so that was good. I managed to get a score of 79.31%. This would give me a pass on the real thing, but I of course want to get that score higher over the coming days. But hey, progress is progress and I'll keep chipping away.
