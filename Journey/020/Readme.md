# AZ-104 Study

## Cloud Research

Tonight I began by running through the Whizlabs practice test I failed last night. I went through each question 1 by 1 and reassessed. I asked myself, do I really know the answer to this question? Even if I got it correct, but it was a slight guess, I read through the accompanying documentation/resources provided by Whizlabs. These are typically links to the official Microsoft documenation which further explain the content. 

## Topics I touched on tonight:
* ![Resource Locks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/lock-resources)
* ![VNet to VNet VPN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-vnet-vnet-resource-manager-portal)
* ![Backing up Azure VMs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-vms-first-look-arm)
* ![Azure FileSync](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-sync-files-deployment-guide?tabs=azure-portal%2Cproactive-portal)
* ![Switching between replication types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/redundancy-migration?tabs=portal#switch-between-types-of-replication)
* ![Access Keys](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage?tabs=azure-portal)

Had I read the questions correctly, I'm realising I probably would have passed the practice exam. Oh well, it's all part of the learning process! I definitely need to brush up on Kubernetes too. I haven't touched on it all through my studies yet. I haven't got round to running through the MS Learn pathway for it. Perhaps I will do that next? If not, I'll definitely need to within the next 10 days.
