# AZ-104 Study

## Cloud Research

Another day of study. 9 days to go, so I'm trying to nail down some more key concepts. Tonight I'm running through the check list provided by Thomas Maurer. Quite a lot on here that I need to run through, but at the moment I feel like there is plenty of time and I'm hoping that I don't need to reschedule the exam.
