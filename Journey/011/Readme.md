# Manage Azure Storage and Azureish Live Stream

## Cloud Research

Tonight I decided to run through Lab 07 - Manage Azure Storage from the Microsoft AZ-104 repo. You can find this here(https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/AZ-104-MicrosoftAzureAdministrator/blob/master/Instructions/Labs/LAB_07-Manage_Azure_Storage.md). A fairly straight forward lab for a Friday night. Helped solidify some knowledge and fill in gaps.

I also tuned in to John Lunn and Gregor Suttie on the Azureish live stream. It was an interesting watch, and I look forward to tuning in again next time.
