# Manage identities and governance in Azure

## Cloud Research

Today I ran through the Manage identities and governance in Azure path on MS Learn. It was a rather heavy session, but I needed to recap on some of this information. Again, just filling in gaps and trying to solidify knowledge for the exam.

Jon Bonso at Tutorials Dojo released a free sample AZ-104 practice exam containing 20 questions recently, so I will probably run through those later on tonight or tomorrow and see where I'm at.
