# WhizLabs Practice Exam

## Cloud Research

It dawned on me today that I only have 11 days until my AZ-104 is scheduled. I decided to take another practice exam and see how I'm getting on. The answer is, not that great! I could throw out a multitude of excuses, but really it's my own fault for having a poor approach to my studies this past week or so. Dipped into some MS Learn tonight, and done the practice exam. Tomorrow I'll be back on the saddle ready to grind out the next 10 days.
