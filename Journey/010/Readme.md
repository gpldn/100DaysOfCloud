# Whizlabs Practice Exam

## Cloud Research

Tonight I thought I'd take a practice test from Whizlabs. It's one I've not done yet, so I know it's not just a case of me repeating and exam and remembering the questions, which is something I was worried about. Overall I'm very happy with the result of 70.91%. Whilst listed as a fail, I believe this would be a pass on the real exam.

One thing that surprised me is the amount of questions I got wrong in the **Manage Azure identities and governance** section. I considered this one of the places I had a better understanding, but apparently not. I will probably revisit this section tomorrow!

I've still got a couple of weeks until my exam date, so I'm starting to feel much more confident in a pass. Still a long way to go and I've got to keep on chipping away at it.
