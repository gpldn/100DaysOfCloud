# Light Reading

## Cloud Research

Following on from the practice yesterday, I've read through the topics I had mentioned:

Load balancers, standard vs basic. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/skus

Azure Recovery Services Vault https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-recovery-services-vault-overview

Azure AD - admin roles https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/devices/assign-local-admin

Azure File Sync https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-sync-files-deployment-guide?tabs=azure-portal%2Cproactive-portal

Admin password reset policies https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-sspr-policy

Azure Disk Encryption https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-sspr-policy https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/secure-your-azure-virtual-machine-disks/2-encryption-options-for-protecting-windows-and-linux-vms

Azure Backup https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-windows-with-mars-agent

App Service Plans https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/app-service/windows/

Application Gateways https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/features

Virtual Network endpoints https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview

I feel like I bridged a few gaps, but still have a long way to go! Didn't get much else done today, it felt like a battle to get through the first 10 minutes. However, even 0.1% progress is better than none. 

## Social Proof

I deleted my personal Twitter account about 4 years ago. Over the past week or so I've considered getting it back to engage with people in the cloud space, but haven't convinced myself yet.
