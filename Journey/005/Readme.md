# Thomas Maurer's Study Guide

## Cloud Research

Today was one of those days where you have to dig really deep and find the energy to study. Work was stressful and normal life gets in the way! However, I still managed to get on with it and study, even it was for a little bit. Today I decided to have a look through Thomas Maurer's AZ-104 study guide here(https://www.thomasmaurer.ch/2020/03/az-104-study-guide-azure-administrator/). It's a very useful article with plenty of resources.

At the moment, I'm just running through the exam topics Thomas has listed and I'm just ticking off if I know how to do X, and if not, read up and find out how to do it. This is likely going to be my approach for the next couple of days.

I'm also trying to find little projects for me to take on, but my main focus at this moment in time is to get certified as soon as possible so I can open myself up to more opportunities. I know with little experience I'm not likely to find many, but the certification will get me through the HR screenings at least! Once I've got the certification I'll run through projects and document them.
