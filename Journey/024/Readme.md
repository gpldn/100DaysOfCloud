# AZ-104 Study

## Cloud Research

Another day of study. 5 days to go.

Today I began with a practice exam before any sort of revision. I wanted to see if I was able to remember and show understanding of the things I've learnt, without recapping on them right before. I passed with 74.55%. It's not the greatest. But now I will run through the things I got wrong and try to understand why.

I've now done all of the practice exams provided by WhizLabs, so I won't revisit them. I think it will give me a false sense of security, because now I will likely remember the questions and their answers. I may look into the MeasureUp exams from Microsoft if I really need to, but hopefully I shouldn't have to.
