# More of the checklist

## Cloud Research

Nothing glamorous today. Just getting on with the checklist and making sure I understand the content in preparation for the AZ-104. Considering tomorrow is Saturday and I'll have more time, I may get into a lab and write something up, rather than making these micro updates everyday. Something practical may give me the boost I need at the moment too.
