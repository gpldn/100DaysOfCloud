## Cloud Research

Today I thought it would be a great idea to go over the key concepts of Azure Virtual Networks. To assist me with this, I found this(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8ePZdLfU7M&t) amazing video from John Savill. 

The content was enjoyable and John explained things in such a simple way that anybody could understand. I'll definitely be having a look through his Masterclass series and will be recommending him to anyone I can in future.

I updated my notes in Notion and will read through these when I get some down time during the days. My Notion notes will mostly be used as quick reference notes so I can stay on my toes and get the content into memory.
