# Getting back to it!

## Cloud Research

So, after a longer break than I initially stated, I'm finally getting back to things. Once I had passed the AZ-104 I was hit with an overwhelming feeling of "What now?". Logic tells me the 204, or the 303 and 304. However, I don't have the development experience at all, and I don't have enough real world experience to tackle the 300 series. My dilemma I felt was, I don't want to become one of those people who are over certified and inexperienced. 

After speaking with some users of the #100DaysOfCloud community, I think I'm going to work toward the 300 series, but I'm not going to set myself any concrete deadline. I feel like this will allow me to get more exposure in Azure, and hopefully throw in some ideas at my work place too. Without any particular criteria to meet to pass an exam, I feel like I will have a bit more freedom and enjoyment of just learning as I go along. Of course, that's subject to change as I go along my journey, but it feels like the right place to start right now.

I've signed myself up to CloudSkills.io and I'll be listening to episode 1 of their 300 series tonight.
