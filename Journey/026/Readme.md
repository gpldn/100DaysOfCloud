# AZ-104 Study

## Cloud Research

Another day of study. 2 days to go.

Just more of the check list from Thomas, reading through my notes, and going over more of the practice test results. I decided to take another one, which I got near 90% but I'm not holding my breathe, as I'm pretty sure it's just me remembering the questions. However, the positive I did take away from that is I understood more why the answers were what they were.
