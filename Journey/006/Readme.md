# Checklist

## Cloud Research

Just went through the checklist from Thomas Maurer's site. Covering through some topics for the 'Manage Azure identities and governance' part of the section. There's a fair bit to brush up on, and I'm just using the links Thomas has posted on his website for those topics. They all seem to link to the official Microsoft documentation. This is likely going to be my approach for the next couple of days. Possibly with another practice test from Whizlabs thrown in.
